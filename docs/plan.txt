Steam Community Helper
======================

Reimplement lost functionality
	- sort games list by the games users have played recently, or at all, rather than own
	- remove free games list - above functionality makes it redundant

Get user's groups (from user's xml)

Get lists of users from other sources
	- user's friends (http://steamcommunity.com/id/raveturned/friends?xml=1)	

Factor html writing code into view package
Factor more logic into service package
	- sorting
	- filtering
	- caching
Hide everything behind interfaces, for encapsulation/testibility/mocking.

Optimise!
Improve CSS.

Issues
	- failure when getting profiles of RPS members
	- Some games get listed twice with same ids? e.g. CoD MW2 & CoD MW2 Multi-Player
